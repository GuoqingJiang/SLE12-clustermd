TODO list for kgraft tools

extract-syms.sh shouldn't use vmlinux.o for extraction, but the
underlying individual .o files.  The sections in vmlinux.o will be
catted together already (for things like data.mostly_read), referencing
too much unrelated stuff.

extract-syms.sh should use an optional inliner tree to expand the set
of symbols to those that have them inlined.  Further it should use
(optionally) filename:symbol pairs for those cases where static functions
need to be extracted whose names happen to occur multiple times in different
units.

Perhaps a top-level script taking a kernel patch, and pulling everything
together should be created (applying patch, building kernel the right way,
extracting stuff and so on).

The seeding symbol list currently needs to come from a human.  It's probably
feasible to generate that list for most cases by interpreting a kernel
diff.  Binary comparison should _not_ be used to generate it.
