Live Kernel Patching with kGraft

kGraft's developement was started by the SUSE Labs. kGraft builds on
technologies and ideas that are already present in the kernel: ftrace
and its mcount-based reserved space in function headers, the
INT3/IPI-NMI patching also used in jumplabels, and RCU-like update of
code that does not require stopping the kernel. For more information
about ftrace please checkout the Documentation shipped with the kernel
or search for howtos and explanations on the Internet.

A kGraft patch is a kernel module and fully relies on the in-kernel
module loader to link the new code with the kernel.  Thanks to all
that, the design can be nicely minimalistic.

While kGraft is, by choice, limited to replacing whole functions and
constants they reference, this does not limit the set of code patches
that can be applied significantly.  kGraft offers tools to assist in
creating the live patch modules, identifying which functions need to
be replaced based on a patch, and creating the patch module source
code. They are located in /tools/kgraft/.
